<h1>Tea Cozy - Codecademy HTML/CSS project</h1>

<h2>Planning phase</h2>
    <p>Looking at the Redline design specifications, I was wondering if it would be best to use a Reset.css stylesheet or something else. After doing some research, reading up on other developers' opinions and recommendations regarding resets as well as normalize.css, I've come to the conclusion that it would probably be best to use a normalize.css sheet. My reasoning is that, since the design specs specify h1-h6 header stylings for various paragraphs and headers, I would have to recreate the stylings by eye, if I decided to reset all of the stylings, as a reset will have all the headers be looking exactly the same.

    Other than that, I don't think there's all that much extra to this one. Since I've started getting more comfortable using flexboxes, and this is a fairly simple layout, I'm going to use flexboxes as much as seems logical.

    If you want to have a look at the specsheet, then simply open "img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg" in the root folder.
